Deploy public images (usually open source) in Docker Deploy is quite easy!

What you have to do is:

1. Go to https://dockerdeploy.cloud/dashboard and Register
2. When logged in, in the dashboard click **+ Create**

3. In the next screen chose:

   - A name for your deployment
   - A size for the deployment. You can start with the smallest one and scale later ;)
   - A Docker Compose file. You can chose one from the [templates](https://github.com/jclapadula/docker-deploy/tree/main/templates) or use another that you already have.
   - An URL for your deployment (optional). If you don't have a domain, we will generate an URL for you.

4. Save your deployment
5. Hit **Deploy**
6. If you bring your own URL, you need to create an A DNS record in the domain, pointing to the IP that is assigned to your deployment.

ðŸš€ Thats it! The services you deployed should be working by now
