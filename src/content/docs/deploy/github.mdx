title: Build and Deploy from GitHub Action
description: This document describes how to re-deploy your deployment from a github action.
---

## Introduction

In this page you will learn how to build and deploy your apps in Docker Deploy from a Github Action, so your app is re-deployed automatically when you push new code.

## Pre-requirements

This guide assumes that you already have a deployment in Docker Deploy that runs.
If that is not the case, you can read the guide on [how to delpoy your app](/deploying-private-images).

## Secrets for deployment

### Access token

Access tokens let you perform actions in Docker Deploy without the need of logging in. This is useful to automate processes, like deploying your app.

To create an access token, go to Account -> [Access Tokens](https://dockerdeploy.cloud/account/accessTokens).

Then pick a name to identify your new Token and hit **Create**.

Save this value somewhere, we will need it later and you will not be able to see it again later.

### Registry credentials

If you want to deploy a private image, you have to publish it in the docker deploy registry.
To deploy on it, you will need your registry credentials. You can see them in your app page, by hitting **Show registry credentials**:

<img src="/images/docs/registry-credentials.png" width="500" />

Keep this values too, as we will also need them to deploy.

### Save the secrets in Github

Now we need to save the Access token and the registry password.

1. Go to the Github repository of your app
2. Settings
3. Secrets and variables -> Actions
4. **New repository secret**
5. Chose a name, like `DD_TOKEN`, and paste the value of your token in the Secret field.
6. If your image is private, you also need to save the registry password, so create another secret called for example `DD_REGISTRY_PASS`
7. Paste the value and save.

At the end, you should have two secrets:

## Create an action

1. Go to Actions in your repository
2. Create a new one
3. Paste this and replace with your values
   - YOUR_REGISTRY_USERNAME: you see it when your press **Show registry credentials** in your deployment page
   - YOUR_REGISTRY_NAMESPACE: you see it when your press **Show registry credentials** in your deployment page
   - YOUR_APP_NAME: A name for your docker image
   - YOUR_APP_ID: Is in the URL of your deployment page `dockerdeploy.cloud/dashboard/deployments/HERE`

```yml
name: Build and deploy
on:
  # Will run on when you push to main
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: registry.dockerdeploy.cloud
          # Replace with your registry username
          username: YOUR_REGISTRY_USERNAME
          password: ${{ secrets.DD_REGISTRY_PASS }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        with:
          push: true
          # Replace with your namespace and app name
          tags: registry.dockerdeploy.cloud/YOUR_REGISTRY_NAMESPACE/YOUR_APP_NAME

      - name: Re-deploy
        run: |
          curl -XPUT -f -H 'Authorization: PAT ${{ secrets.DD_TOKEN }}' \
          'https://api.dockerdeploy.cloud/api/deployments/YOUR_APP_ID/deploy'
```

Thats it! Now, every time you push to main, you image will be built and deployed into Docker Deploy.
