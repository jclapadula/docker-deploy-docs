## Push the image to the private registry

In the action where you build and push the image:

1. Use your private registry credentials in `docker/login-action@v3`. You also have to add `registry: registry.dockerdeploy.cloud`.
2. Dont forget to add the proper tag to your image so it's pushed to your private registry. In `docker/build-push-action@v5` you would have something like: `tags: registry.dockerdeploy.cloud/youNamespace/your-app-name`

Now you are ready to use your image in you deployment
