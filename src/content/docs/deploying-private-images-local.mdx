## Pre-requirements

To be able to deploy your app, your will first need the following:

1. An app that runs.
2. A Dockerfile that builds your image properly
3. An account in dockerdeploy.cloud

If something in this list is missing, go fix/get it first and then come back!

## Build and publish the image

1. Run `npm i dockerdeploy-cli -g` to instal the cli
2. Run `dd-cli publish` to build and publish your image

After building the image, you will see the **image tag** in the terminal. You can use it to reference your image in your compose files.
