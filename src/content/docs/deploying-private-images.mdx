## Introduction

In this page you will learn how to deploy your apps in Docker Deploy.
But first let's take a look on where are you private images stored.

### Where is your image stored?

For Docker Deploy to deploy your image, we need to be able to pull it. That's why you get a private repository from us (included in the account) to push your images, either from your CI/CD pipeline or directly from your computer.

## Build and push your image

### Build your image

[Building and publish from your computer](/deploying-private-images-local)

[Building and publish from Github](/deploying-private-images-github)

## Reference your image

Now you only need to reference your image in your Docker Compose file ([see example](https://github.com/jclapadula/docker-deploy/blob/main/templates/.yourApp.yml)):
