## Introduction

In this page you will learn how to deploy your apps in Docker Deploy.
But first let's take a look on where are you private images stored.

**Where is your image stored?**

For Docker Deploy to deploy your image, we need to be able to pull it. That's why you get a private repository from us (included in the account) to push your images, either from your CI/CD pipeline or directly from your computer.

## Pre-requirements

To be able to deploy your app, your will first need the following:

1. An app that runs.
2. A Dockerfile that builds your image properly
3. An account on [Docker Deploy](https://dockerdeploy.cloud/dashboard)

If something in this list is missing, go fix/get it first and then come back!

## Build and push your image

To be able to deploy your app locally, your will first need to install the [Docker Deploy CLI](/quickstart/cli).

Then just run `dd-cli build` where your Dockerfile is located to build and publish your image into the image registry.

After building the image, you will see the **image tag** in the terminal. You can use it to reference your image in your compose files.

## Reference your image

Now you only need to reference your image in your Docker Compose file ([see example](https://github.com/jclapadula/docker-deploy/blob/main/templates/.yourApp.yml)):
