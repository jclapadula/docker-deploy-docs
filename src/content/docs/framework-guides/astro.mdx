title: Deploy an Astro app (SSR)
description: This document describes how to deploy your Astro app with server side rendering (SSR) into Docker Deploy
---

## Introduction

In this guide you will learn how to Dockerize and deploy your Astro app with SSR (server side rendering) in Docker Deploy.

For more info on SSR in Astro, [read the official docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering).

## Pre-requisites

Before starting this guide, make sure you have:

- A running Astro app
- An account on [Docker Deploy](https://dockerdeploy.cloud/dashboard)

## Add SSR support

> If you have already installed the Node adapter, you can go to the next step

In the root of your project, run:

```
npx astro add node
```

This will add the needed dependencies and update your configuration to support SSR.

By default, your app will render all your pages in the server at runtime. If you want to pre-render some pages, you can [find more information here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#opting-in-to-pre-rendering-in-server-mode).

## Dockerize your app

> If you can already build a docker image for you app, go to the next step

_This guides follows the [official docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/docker/#ssr)_

In the root of your project (where package.json is), add the following files:

**Dockerfile**

```Dockerfile
FROM node:lts-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

ENV HOST=0.0.0.0
ENV PORT=4321
EXPOSE 4321
CMD node ./dist/server/entry.mjs
```

and **.dockerignore**

```
.DS_Store
node_modules
dist
```

These two files will allow you to build a Docker image for your Astro app.

## Build and Deploy with the CLI

### Instal the CLI

Run `npm i dockerdeploy-cli -g` to install the CLI in your PC.

Then run `dd-cli login` to log in your user in the CLI.

### Build and Deploy

You can run `dd-cli build` to build your docker image and push it to your private repository.

Afterwards, you just need to run `dd-cli deploy` to deploy the image that you just build into Docker Deploy.
After deploying, you will get the URL to manage that deployment and the automatically generated URL.

### Adjust the port

By default, the deployments created through the CLI will listen to the port 80 of your app, but Astro exposes port 4321 by default. So you have to go to you deployment in [the dashboard](https://dockerdeploy.cloud/dashboard), and change the ports section as follows:

```yml
ports:
  - "80:80"
```

to

```yml
ports:
  - "80:4321"
```

## Ready!

You can now visit your site under the autogenerated dockerdeploy.cloud URL!
