## Introduction

In this guide you will learn how to Dockerize and deploy your Next.js app into Docker Deploy.

## Pre-requisites

Before starting this guide, make sure you have:
- A running Next.js app
- An account on [Docker Deploy](https://dockerdeploy.cloud/dashboard)

## Dockerize your app

> If you can already build a docker image for you app, go to the next step

You need to bring the following files from the [Next.js Docker example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker)
- [.dockerignore](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/main/examples/with-docker/.dockerignore)
- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/main/examples/with-docker/Dockerfile)

Download both files and paste them in the root folder of your project, the same where **package.json** is.

These files tell Docker how to build the image of your app.

Next, you have to set the output of your app to **"standalone"** in your **next.config.mjs** file.
So it should like this
```ts
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: "standalone",
  // ... rest of your config
};

export default nextConfig;
```

With that, you should be able to dockerize your Next.js app.

## Build and Deploy with the CLI

### Instal the CLI

Run ``npm i dockerdeploy-cli -g`` to install the CLI in your PC.

Then run ``dd-cli login`` to log in your user in the CLI.

### Build and Deploy

You can run ``dd-cli build`` to build your docker image and push it to your private repository.

Afterwards, you just need to run ``dd-cli deploy`` to deploy the image that you just build into Docker Deploy.
After deploying, you will get the URL to manage that deployment and the automatically generated URL.

### Adjust the port
By default, the deployments created through the CLI will listen to the port 80 of your app, but Next.js exposes port 3000 by default. So you have to go to you deployment in [the dashboard](https://dockerdeploy.cloud/dashboard), and change the ports section as follows:

```
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```
to
```
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
```

## Ready!
