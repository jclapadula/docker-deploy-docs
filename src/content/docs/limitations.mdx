## Exposed services and ports

As of now, you can expose only **HTTP** services in Docker Deploy. That means that you can still have a DB in your deployment, but it will not be accessible from the internet.

Your service must specify one of the following ports:
- 80
- 8081-8085

Internally it can listen to any port, but from the internet, only one of those can be used.

> If you are interested in exposing a different port or a non-http service, please [get in touch](mailto:support@dockerdeploy.cloud)
