## Ports

You can only use one of the following ports to make your services accessible:
- 80
- 8081-8085

Internally your services listen to any port, but from the internet, only one of those can be used.

That means your "ports" section will likely look like:

```
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```
or
```
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
```
or
```
    ports:
      - "8081:5432"
```

But the number before **":"** should be one one of those mentioned above.

## Architecture

You can deploy both ARM and AMD64 images, but on our current infrastructure the ARM deployments will give you better performance for the same price.
