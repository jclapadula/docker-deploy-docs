title: Limitations
description: This document describes how the limitations present when deploying in Docker Deploy.
---

## Architecture

You can only deploy docker images with ARM architecture. **All popular images support this platform**, but if you are building your own image, you will have to either do it in an ARM PC (github has ARM runners) or using an emulator.

## Ports

You can only use one of the following ports to make your services accessible:
- 80
- 8081-8085

Internally your services listen to any port, but from the internet, only one of those can be used.

That means your "ports" section will likely look like:

```
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```
or
```
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
```
or
```
    ports:
      - "8081:5432"
```

But the number before **":"** should be one one of those mentioned above.
