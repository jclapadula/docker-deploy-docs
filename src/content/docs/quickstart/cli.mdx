## Introduction

In this guide you will learn how to install and use the Docker Deploy CLI. The CLI will help you build the docker images for your apps and deploy them in the platform.

## Pre-requirements

- To use the CLI you need Node.js installed in your PC. If you don't have it, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- An account on [Docker Deploy](https://dockerdeploy.cloud/dashboard).

## Install the CLI and log in

To install the CLI you just need to run:
```
npm i dockerdeploy-cli -g
```
That way, the CLI is installed in your PC and you are ready to use it.

Before creating and deploying images, you need to login into the CLI.
```
dd-cli login
```

## Help
Call the CLI without arguments to see what you can do with it:

```
dd-cli
```
